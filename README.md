# Minimal configuration for a basic programming language

We are implementing a programming language, more specifically an interpreter in Rust. This is very high level, since we use some libraries to help us with the parsing, but still serves the learning purpose.

## Theory

1. Lex
2. Parse tokens and create AST
3. Interpret or compile the AST
